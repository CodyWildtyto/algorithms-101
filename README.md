## Algorithms

### Stack

A way to handle data structures with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method. Similarly putting down or picking up a book from stacking books in real life.

```
Stack: {
	size: Int
	isEmpty: Boolean
	push: Function
	pop: Function
	clear: Function
	peek: Function
	print: Function
}
```

### Queue

Another method First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to handle data structures. It is common in people enter a line for ticket.

```
Queue: {
	size: Int
	isEmpty: Boolean
	enqueue: Function
	dequeue: Function
	front: Function
	clear: Function
	print: Function
}
```

## Example

### Base Converter

Converting numbers to binary or else with Stack.

### Hot Potato
